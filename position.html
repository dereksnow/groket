      <h2>Basic Positioning</h2>

      <p>CSS allows elements to be positioned relative to how they would appear
      in normal flow, removed from normal flow completely and positioned with
      respect to the containing element, or positioned with respect to the
      browser window. The most difficult part of learning about positioning is
      understanding the unintuitive naming of the types of positioning.
      Let&#39;s take a look at the different values for the position property
      and what they mean.</p>

      <h3>In the Flow</h3>

      <dl>
        <dt>static</dt>

        <dd>Static is the default value for the position property. This means
        the element will be positioned as it occurs in normal document
        flow.</dd>

        <dt>relative</dt>

        <dd>Relative positioning moves the element relative to its default
        (static) position. Relative positioning keeps the element in normal
        flow and the element still occupies its default position, it&#39;s just
        repositioned relative to the default.</dd>
      </dl>

      <h3>Out of the Flow</h3>

      <dl>
        <dt>absolute</dt>

        <dd>Absolute</dd>

        <dt>fixed</dt>

        <dd>Fixed</dd>
      </dl>
