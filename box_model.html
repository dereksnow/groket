            <h2>The Basics</h2>
	    <p>In the <a href="layout_html_overview.html">HTML Overview</a> we
	    saw that every HTML element exists within a rectangle or box on a
	    page. This box has the properties of width, min-width, max-width, height,
	    min-height, max-height, padding, border and margin that can be
	    applied and modified. Understanding the <em>box model</em>, as it
	    is known, is essential to creating layouts that
	    reflect your design. Below we have a basic illustration of the
	    <em>box model</em> which we'll discuss in detail in this
	    lesson.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <h3>Width and Height</h3>
	    <p>The width and height properties, by default, control the width
	    and height of the content area. The default value for the width
	    and height properties is set to auto, which allows the browser to
	    calculate and select a width/height for the element. Length values for
	    width and height followed by a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length#Units">unit</a> (e.g. em, px, rem) can be used
	    to provide an exact size of the content area. Percentage values
	    can also be used so that the width/height will fill the specified
	    percentage of the containing block's width/height.</p> 
	    <p>The min-width and min-height is used to ensure a minimum
	    width/height of an element and overrides the width/height value.
	    The max-width and max-height are similar, but control the maximum
	    width/height and also override the width/height value. Setting the
	    min-width/height (max-width/height) is often used for cases
	    when a browser is resized and you want to ensure the content area
	    is no smaller (larger) than a particular size.</p>
	    <p>The width and height properties can be set to be inclusive of
	    the padding and border using the <a
	    href="#BoxSizing">box-sizing</a> property.</p>
            <h3>Content Area and Edge</h3>
	    <p>The content area contains the actual content - text, image,
	    etc. You can specify the width and height of the content area for
		    block-level elements and <a
			    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Replaced_element">replaced
			    inline elements</a> (e.g. images) using CSS, but
		    you cannot specify the width and height for non-replaced
		    elements (e.g. span, strong, em, etc.).  </p>
	    <p>The content edge is not actually a visible edge as illustrated
	    above, but it represents the outer edge of the content area and
	    the inner padding edge, if any padding exists.</p> <h3>Padding
	    Area and Edge</h3> 
	    <p>The padding is an optional area between the content and an
	    optional border. Padding is often used to provide "breathing room"
	    between the content and the border for readability and aesthetics.
	    </p>
	    <p>The padding edge is not actually visible as illustrated above,
	    but it represents the outer edge of the padding area and the inner
	    edge of the border.</p> <p>Padding can be specified using CSS
	    declarations for each individual side using
                <strong>padding-top</strong>, <strong>padding-right</strong>,
                <strong>padding-bottom</strong>, and
                <strong>padding-left</strong>.</p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">padding-top: 10px;
padding-right: 10px;
padding-bottom: 10px;
padding-left: 10px;
</code></pre>
            <h4 id="PaddingShorthand">Shorthand for Padding Declarations</h4>
            <p>The previous four declarations can also be written with the following short-hand notation.</p>
            <pre><code class="language-css">padding: 10px;</code></pre>
            <p>
		This is the shorthand notation when all the sides have the
		same padding value. What if you have different values? The
		shorthand still works, you just need to specify enough
		information.  </p>
	    <p>Before looking at the other shorthand notation syntax, you
	    should remember the following: <em>Start at the Top and move like
	    a clock</em>. What does this mean? It's hopefully an easy way to
    remember the order in which the sides are specified for padding shorthand
    notation. You specify the padding in clockwise order: <em>top</em>,
                <em>right</em>, <em>bottom</em> and <em>left</em>.
            </p>
            <p>Shorthand for all four sides having different padding values.</p>
            <div class="syntax">
	      padding: top right bottom left;
            </div>
	    <pre><code class="language-css">padding: 20px 10px 30px 15px;</code></pre>
	    <p>Shorthand for the left and right sides being the same and the
	    top and bottom values being different. Note the ordering is still
	    clockwise, but the value for the right also specifies the left
	    value when using the three value shorthand notation.</p> 
	    <div class="syntax">
                padding: top right/left bottom;
            </div>
	    <pre><code class="language-css">padding: 20px 10px 15px;</code></pre>
	    <p>Shorthand for the top and bottom having one value and the right
	    and left sides having another value.</p> 
	    <div class="syntax">padding: top/bottom right/left;</div>
	    <pre><code class="language-css">padding: 20px 10px;</code></pre>
            <h3>Border Area and Edge</h3>
	    <p>The border is another optional area between the optional
	    padding and margin areas. The border properties width, style, and
	    color can be modified, and each side can have a different border
	    or no border.</p> <p>The border edge is not actually visible as
	    illustrated, but represents the outer edge of the border, if it
	    exists, and the inner edge of the optional margin.</p>
	    <p>A solid black border with a width of 2 pixels would be specified as follows:
            </p>
	    <pre><code class="language-css">border-width: 2px;<br>
style: solid;<br>
color: black;</code></pre>
	    <p>There is also shorthand notation for specifying the border:</p>
	    <div class="syntax">
	        border: border-width border-style border-color;
	    </div>
	    <pre><code class="language-css">border: 2px solid black;</code></pre>
	    <p>Each side can have its own width, style and color specified
	    using the following syntax.</p>
	    <div class="syntax">
	      border-&lt;side&gt;-width: border-width;
	    </div>
	    <div class="syntax">
	      border-&lt;side&gt;-style: border-style;
	    </div>
	    <div class="syntax">
	      border-&lt;side&gt;-color: border-color;
	    </div>
	    <p>Where &lt;side&gt; would be replaced by <em>top</em>, <em>right</em>, <em>bottom</em>
	    or <em>left</em>.</p>
	    <p>Valid values for the properties:
	    <a
		    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-width#Values">border-width</a>,
	    <a
		    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-style#Values">border-style</a>
	    and
	    <a
		    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-color#Syntax">border-color</a>.</p>
	    <h3>Margin Area and Outer Edge</h3>
	    <p>The margin is an optional area between the optional border and
	    other elements. Margins are what keep elements from "bumping" into
	    one another and are always transparent so that the parent
	    element's background will show through the margin.</p>
	    <p>The outer margin edge is not actually visible as depicted in the Box
	    Model illustration, but it represents the outer rectangular perimeter of
	    the element on the page. Any area outside of the outer edge would
	    belong to another element.</p>
	    <p>Margins can be specified using CSS declarations for each
	    individual side much like padding, <strong>margin-top</strong>,
	    <strong>margin-right</strong>, <strong>margin-bottom</strong>,
	    <strong>margin-left</strong>.</p>
	    <pre><code class="language-css">margin-top: 10px;<br>
margin-right: 10px;<br>
margin-bottom: 10px;<br>
margin-left: 10px;<br>
</code></pre>
	    <p>The shorthand notation for margins follows the same <a
		    href="#PaddingShorthand">
notation
	    as padding</a>, but in place of <em>padding</em> in the declarations, you use <em>margin</em>.</p>
	    <p>Let's look at an example that uses the box model's optional
	    padding, border, and margin areas.
            </p>

            <h3>Take Note:</h3>
            <ul class="notes">
		<li>Note that the paragraph element is left aligned. This is
		the default behavior for elements.</li>
		<li>The padding on the paragraph pushes the content area
		containing text away from the paragraph element's border.</li>
                <li>The margin on the paragraph pushes the paragraph element
		away from the padding of the div.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Things to try:</h3>
            <ul class="exercises">
                <li>Change the border's style to dashed and the color to red.</li>
                <li>Remove the padding on the div container. Note anything
		that appears odd. We will discuss this behavior in the next
		section <em>Collapsing Margins</em></li>
		<li>Modify the padding and margins of the div and paragraph
		elements. Note anything that may seem odd.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Collapsing Margins</h2>
	    <p>In the previous <em>Things to try</em>, when the padding was
	    removed from the div container we could see the light blue
	    background color of the body above the outer edge of the div and
	    paragraph. This is the result of collapsing margins.
	    In the <a
		    href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html#collapsing-margins">CSS
	    2.1 specification</a>
	    , top and bottom margins of adjacent and also parent/child
	    block-level elements sometimes combine (collapse) into a single
	    margin that will have the size of
	    the larger of the two collapsed margins. </p>
	    <p>Here's the quick summary for collapsing margins.</p>
	    <ul class="summary">
	    	<li>Horizontal margins never collapse.</li>
	    	<li>The vertical margins of adjacent siblings will collapse, unless
		a later sibling needs to be cleared (discussed in Float
		section).</li>
		<li>The top margin of the first child element and the bottom margin of
		the last child element (for a single child element, the
		first and last are the same) will collapse with the parent
		element's margin except when a border, padding, inline content, or
		clearing (discussed in Float lesson) separates the two
		margins. The collapsed margin will exist outside of the parent element.</li>
		<li>If there is nothing (border, padding, inline content or
		height) to separate a block element's top and bottom margin,
		the margins will collapse. This is the case of empty blocks,
		which are not as common as the previous two cases.</li>
	    </ul>
	    <p>It is the third case that was being exhibited when the padding
	    was removed from the div container in the previous example. The
	    top and bottom margins collapsed and the single collapsed margin
	    became 10px (in this case the margin on the div was 0). The reason
	    the background color of the body was visible, is that the
	    collapsed margin exists outside of the parent element (the div).</p>
	    <p>Let's look at an example that illustrates the case of sibling
	    vertical margins collapsing.</p>
	    <figure>
	    <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/qoxipa/1/embed?html,css,output">Collapsing Margins</a><script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.js"></script>
	    </figure>
            <h3>Take Note:</h3>
            <ul class="notes">
		<li><em>auto</em> is used to preserve the default left and right margins.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Things to try:</h3>
            <ul class="exercises">
                <li>Change the paragraph's top and bottom margin from 20px to
		40px. You should notice that the margin between the two paragraphs
		does not change because of the collapsing margin behavior. Any
		value less than or equal to 40px will not reflect a change of
		the margin between the two paragraphs, but the top margin of
		the first paragraph will match the specified value.
		</li>
                <li>Change the paragraph's top and bottom margin to 50px and
		notice that the margin between the two paragraphs increases
		(in this case 10 pixels).</li>
		<li>Add additional paragraphs adjust
		the margins until you feel like you "grok it".</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="BoxSizing">Width and Height Calculations and Box-sizing</h2>
	    <p>In creating a website, you will often need to know the width
	    and height that an element will occupy on a page to achieve a
	    desired layout. The default width and height that an element will
	    occupy on a page is calculated by the following: </p>
	    <p class="equation">element width = left margin + left border +
	    left padding + width + right padding + right border + right
	    margin</p>
	    <p class="equation">element height = top margin + top border +
	    top padding + height + bottom padding + bottom border + bottom
	    margin</p>
	    <p>
	    Often the padding will be added or modified once a layout is
	    defined and text is added. This will usually require adjustments
	    to the width and height, since the width and height, by default,
	    does not include padding.
	    The CSS3 UI specification addresses this issue with the <a
		    href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-ui/#box-sizing">
		    box-sizing
	    property</a>.
            The box-sizing property allows for the width to include only the content
	    area, the default, or for the width to also include padding or for
	    the width to also include padding and the border.</p>
	    <table class="table table-hover table-condensed">
		    <colgroup>
		    <col span="1" style="width: 20%">
		    <col span="1" style="width: 80%">
		    </colgroup>
		    <tr>
		    	<th>box-sizing value</th>
		    	<th class="text-center">Description</th>
		    </tr>
		    <tr>
		    	<td>content-box</td>
		    	<td>The width and height only account for the content
			area. Any padding, border or margin has to be
			accounted separately when default terming the space that
			is occupied by an element. This is the default value.
	                </td> 
                    </tr>
		    <tr>
		    	<td>padding-box</td>
		    	<td>The width and height include the content area and
			the padding, but does not include the border or
			margin. This value has limited very limited browser
			support.</td>
		    </tr>
		    <tr>
		    	<td>border-box</td>
		    	<td>The width and height include the content area, the
			padding and the border, but does not include the
			margin. This value has wide support with modern
			browsers.</td>
		    </tr>
	    </table>
	    <p>Let's look at an example where we can see and experiment with
	    using the default content-box value and the widely supported
	    border-box value for the box-sizing property.</p>
	    <figure>
	       <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/quwomu/1/embed?html,css,output">Box-sizing</a>
	    <script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.js"></script>
	    <figcaption>Class names are not semantic and in general a
	    single box-sizing value would be applied to all elements.</figcaption>
	    </figure>
            <h3>Take Note:</h3>
            <ul class="notes">
		<li>Note that two paragraphs have the content-box value
		applied and two paragraphs have the border-box value applied
		for the box-sizing property.</li>
		<li>All paragraphs have the same border, padding and margin
		applied so that each paragraph element (including margin) will
		occupy 132px in width.</li> <li>The width has been set for the
		content-box 
		paragraphs and the border-box paragraphs so that two
		paragraphs can fit exactly side-by-side within a 264px div.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Things to try:</h3>
            <ul class="exercises">
                <li>Change the border from 1px to
		2px. Note that the border-box paragraphs handle this change so
		that the paragraphs continue to sit side-by-side. The
		content-box paragraph are now too wide for the div and cannot
		sit side-by-side. Revert your changes.</li>
                <li>Change the padding from 10px to 15px. Again, the
		border-box paragraphs accommodate this change but the
		content-box paragraphs are once again too wide to sit
		side-by-side. Revert your changes.</li>
		<li>Change the margin from 5px to 6px. Neither the content-box
		or border-box paragraphs can accommodate this change since
		neither take the margin into account when calculating the
		width. While it is not as common to modify the margin as padding
		and borders, it's important to know that margin is not
		accounted for in the width of border-box elements.</li>
            </ul>
	    <p>As experienced in the previous <em>Things to try</em>, it is often
	    easier to work with the box-sizing property set to border-box than
	    content-box. The current <a href="http://css-tricks.com/inheriting-box-sizing-probably-slightly-better-best-practice/">best practice</a> for applying box-border to
	    all elements is provided below.</p>
	    <pre><code class="language-css">html {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
*, *:before, *:after {
  box-sizing: inherit;
}</code></pre>
	    <h2>Overflow</h2>
	    <p>Sometimes the content of an element will be too large for the
	    specified content area size. So, what happens to the content? Is it chopped
	    off? Does it "overflow" outside of the element? Do you get
	    scrollbars? The answer depends on the value that is set for the
	    overflow property.</p>
	    <p>Let's look at an example that illustrates the behavior of the
	    overflow property with its four possible values: visible, hidden,
	    scroll and auto.</p>
            <figure>
	   <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/kegasu/4/embed?html,css,output">Overflow</a><script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.js"></script> 
	    </figure>
	    <h3>Take Note:</h3>
	    <p>The following table summarizes the four overflow values.</p>
	    <table class="table table-hover table-condensed">
		    <colgroup>
		    <col span="1" style="width: 20%">
		    <col span="1" style="width: 80%">
		    </colgroup>
		    <tr>
		    	<th>Overflow Value</th>
		    	<th class="text-center">Description</th>
		    </tr>
		    <tr>
		    	<td>visible</td>
		    	<td>Allows for the content to visibly overflow outside
			of the element. This is the default value.</td> 
                    </tr>
		    <tr>
		    	<td>hidden</td>
		    	<td>Any content that does not fit within the content
				area will be clipped.</td>
		    </tr>
		    <tr>
		    	<td>scroll</td>
			<td>Scrollbars are added to allow the user to scroll
				through the content. The scrollbars will be
			present even if the content fits within the content
		area.</td>
		    </tr>
		    <tr>
		    	<td>auto</td>
			<td>The browser handles overflow where scrollbars will
				usually be added if the content is larger than
			the content area.</td>
		    </tr>
	    </table>
	    <p>Which value you set for the overflow property will depend on
	    several factors: the type of content within the element, the
	    adjacent content, the layout, containing elements etc. This lesson
	    will not explore when to use which values, but you can do a web

                <li>Every element on a web page is contained within a "box"
		that has a height, width, optional padding, optional border
		and optional margin that can be modified using CSS.</li>
                <li>Vertical margins can sometimes collapse, but horizontal
		margins never collapse.</li>
		<li>The box-sizing property, by default is set to content-box,
		which specifies that the height and width property will only
		account for the content area. If the value is set to border-box,
		then any padding and border will also be included in the
		height and width.</li>
                <li>The overflow property can be used to specify what happens
		to the content when it is too large for the content area.</li>
