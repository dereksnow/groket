      <h2>Normal Flow</h2>

      <p>The CSS layout model specifies that elements are laid out from top to
      bottom and from left to right by default. This is what we call the
      <strong>normal flow</strong> of elements. Let&#39;s take a closer look at
      an example that shows the normal layout of elements.</p>

      <h3>Take Note:</h3>

      <ul class="notes">
        <li>Block and inline elements are laid out top to bottom and from left
        to right. The block elements (divs) by default occupy the width of the
        containing element. The inline elements (two imgs and a span) sit
        adjacent to each other and wrap to the next line only when the width of
        the <em>container</em> div is exceeded.</li>

        <li>Each div within the container div has been given a height and a
        width.</li>

        <li>There is a space between the images and the div below it. The
        images sit on the same baseline as the text. The leg of the letter
        &quot;p&quot; in &quot;Span&quot; sits below the baseline. This space
        for descenders will exist by default even if there isn&#39;t a letter
        that has a descender.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Things to try:</h3>

      <ul class="exercises">
        <li>Remove the letter &quot;p&quot; in &quot;Span&quot; to show that
        the space between the images and the div below it is maintained. This
        space can be removed by changing the vertical-align (default is
        baseline) property of the image to <em>top</em> (<a href=
        "http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#propdef-vertical-align">other
        values</a> will also work).
        </li>

        <li>Change the <em>container</em> div width to 100px and notice how the
        images and text wrap.</li>

        <li>Add or remove block and inline elements to see how they are laid
        out with normal flow.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Floating</h2>

      <p>The rest of this lesson will look at how we can take elements out of
      the normal flow of a page using the float property. Elements are not
      floated by default, but when the value of <em>left</em> or <em>right</em>
      is assigned to the float property, the element is moved as far left or
      right as possible. This allows any line boxes that comes after the
      floated element to wrap around it. A line box is the rectangular area
      that contains the boxes that form a line. Let&#39;s look at an example
      that illustrates these concepts and the basics of a floated element.</p>

      <figure>

        "http://jsbin.com/qadoda/10/embed?html,css,output">Basic
        Floating</a><script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.js">
</script>
      </figure>

      <h3>Take Note:</h3>

      <ul class="notes">
        <li>The image is the only element that has a non-default float value,
        in this case <em>left</em>. Since the image is floated, it is initially
        positioned within the normal flow, but then taken out of the flow and
        shifted left as far as possible.</li>

        <li>Since the image is outside of the normal flow, the &quot;box&quot;
        for the paragraph and div are placed normally.</li>

        <li>The paragraph has a purple border and fills the width of the
        containing element, even though the left most edge is hidden by the
        image.</li>

        <li>The line box that surrounds the text within the paragraph and div
        with a blue background has a red dotted border. These line boxes always
        exist but cannot been seen without attaching span with a border. Notice
        that the line box is affected by the floated image and wraps around the
        image, unlike the paragraph block with the purple border or the
        div.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Things to try:</h3>

      <ul class="exercises">
        <li>Change the float for the image from left to right and notice the
        changes. Revert your changes.</li>

        <li>Add a margin to the img tag of 10px to reveal the left border of
        the paragraph.</li>

        <li>Remove the image and notice how the line boxes wrap to fill the
        containing space.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Inline Text Floated</h2>

      <p>Floating inline text is performed in the same basic way as we did the
      image, but a width should always be specified. A width is needed since
      most browsers will have the text fill the width of the containing element
      by default. Let&#39;s take a look at an example of floating text.</p>

      <figure>

        Text</a><script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.js">
</script>
      </figure>

      <h3>Take Note:</h3>

      <ul class="notes">
        <li>A width is specified for the floated span to ensure it doesn&#39;t
        fill the width of the containing element (or collapse to zero
        width).</li>

        <li>A top and bottom margin is generated for floated inline text, these
        top and bottom margins wouldn&#39;t exist with non-floated inline text.
        Floated inline text behaves like a block element.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Things to try:</h3>

      <ul class="exercises">
        <li>Remove the width declaration to see the span text occupy the width
        of the containing paragraph.</li>

        <li>Change the float value from left to right.</li>

        <li>Add additional inline text elements and float them to the left or
        right to see the behavior.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Block Elements Floated</h2>

      <p>Floating a block element is similar to floating an inline element,
      where you will need to provide a width so the element doesn&#39;t occupy
      the width of the containing element. Let&#39;s look at an example.</p>

      <figure>

        "http://jsbin.com/hasor/2/embed?html,css,output">Floating Block
        Elements</a><script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.js">
</script>
      </figure>

      <h3>Take Note:</h3>

      <ul class="notes">
        <li>A width is specified for both floated block elements so they do not
        fill the width of the containing element.</li>

        <li>Note that both floated paragraphs (i.e. with classes side1 and
        side2) sit below the paragraphs that precede them. This is because
        floated elements can never be higher than any block elements that
        precede them.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Things to try:</h3>

      <ul class="exercises">
        <li>Change the float values for side1 and side2 classes, so that side1
        is floated right and side2 is floated left.</li>

        <li>Add additional floated block elements.</li>

        <li>Reorder the block elements in the HTML to see how the ordering
        affects the layout of floated block elements.</li>
      </ul>
