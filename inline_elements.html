            <h2>The Basics</h2>
            <p><strong>Inline elements are HTML elements that are laid out
			horizontally one after the other.</strong> They do not begin on a new line by default. Some commonly used inline elements include anchor, img, span, button, input, label and textarea.</p>
            <p>Below is a code example containing elements that are inline by default.</p>

            <h3>Take Note:</h3>
            <ul class="notes">
                <li>The width of an inline element is generally determined by its content.</li>
                <li>An inline element can be contained within a <a href="block_elements.html">block-level element</a>.</li>
                <li>An inline element in general cannot contain a block-level
		element.</li>
                <li>Inline elements can contain other inline elements like the &lt;a&gt; element that is contained within the &lt;strong&gt; element in the above example.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Things to try:</h3>
            <ul class="exercises">
                <li>Resize the output area and notice the behavior of the
		inline elements. The elements should fill horizontally and
		wrap when the container is not wide enough for the contents.</li>
                <li>Modify the HTML code so the &lt;strong&gt; element is
		within the &lt;a&gt; element. Does the link still work? Is the
		text still bold? While visually it doesn't seem to make a
		difference, you should keep in mind what you are trying to add
		strong importance to - the link or the text for the link.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>The SPAN element</h2>
            <p><strong>The &lt;span&gt; element is an inline element without any
			semantics, other than those that you apply with id or class
			attributes.</strong> It is frequently used to style a group of
                <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/dom.html#phrasing-content-2">phrasing elements</a>, but it should not be used when a semantic element (e.g. strong, em, big, small, etc.) would be better suited for the
                content.</p>
            <p>The jsbin below uses the span element to style the inline elements with a light blue color.</p>

            <h3>Take Note:</h3>
            <ul class="notes">
                <li>The span element doesn't add anything visually by itself.</li>
                <li>class or id attributes are often added to span elements so that text can be targeted by css or javascript.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Things to try:</h3>
            <ul class="exercises">
                <li>Remove the class attribute from the span to show that the span element doesn't make visual changes by itself.</li>
                <li>Add additional text and use span elements and css to style some of the text.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>HTML5 and Inline Elements</h2>
            <p>In HTML5 <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/indices.html#element-content-categories">Element content categories</a> were introduced, which replaced the simple block-level and inline distinction, but the block-level/inline
                categorization is still used in discussing the default behavior of elements. Mozilla provides a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Block-level_elements">listing of block-level elements</a> that also includes HTML5
                elements that are technically not defined within the block-level/inline categorization.</p>
            <h2>Big Ideas</h2>
            <ul class="big-ideas">
                <li>Inline elements are laid out horizontally one after the other.</li>
                <li>The width of an inline element is generally determined by
		its content.</li>
                <li>Inline elements can contain other inline elements.</li>
                <li>An inline element, in general, cannot contain a
		block-level element.
                <li>The span element is an inline element without any
		semantics that is used to style phrasing elements.</li>
            </ul>
