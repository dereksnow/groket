      <h2>Clearing Past Floats</h2>

      <p>There are cases where you may not want an element to wrap next to a
      floated element. In these cases you will want to clear the element past
      the floated element. The <em>clear</em> property by default has the value
      of <em>none</em>, but can also have the values of <em>left</em>,
      <em>right</em>, and <em>both</em> to clear an element past a floated
      left, floated right or both left and right floated elements respectively.
      Let&#39;s look at an example:</p>

      <figure>
        <a class="jsbin-embed" href=
        "http://jsbin.com/waxax/1/embed?html,css,output">Clearing
        Floats</a><script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.js">
</script>
      </figure>

      <h3>Take Note:</h3>

      <ul class="notes">
        <li>The clear is placed on the header element that we don&#39;t want to
        wrapping around the floated image.</li>

        <li>Since the image was floated left, a value of left was applied to
        the clear property for the H2 element.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Things to try:</h3>

      <ul class="exercises">
        <li>Change the clear value from left to right and notice that the
        header is no longer cleared.</li>

        <li>Copy the image code, paste it below the first paragraph, add a
        class of <em>side2</em> and give the <em>float</em> property a value of
        <em>right</em> for this class.</li>

        <li>Change the clear value from right to both. Now the header is
        cleared past both left and right floats.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Creating Menus with Floats</h2>

      <p>The unordered list is semantically the best choice to create a
      navigation menu. Using CSS you can remove the default bullets next to
      each list item, float the list items to the left or right and apply
      additional styles to achieve a nice navigation menu. Let&#39;s look at an
      example.</p>

      <figure>
        <a class="jsbin-embed" href=
        "http://jsbin.com/hegal/1/embed?html,css,output">Creating Menus with
        Floats</a><script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.js">
</script>
      </figure>

      <h3>Take Note:</h3>

      <ul class="notes">
        <li>The html5 nav tag is used to surround the unordered list. For
        semantic correctness, the nav tag should be used anytime you are
        creating a navigation menu.</li>

        <li>The list-style-type property for the ul is set to none. This
        removes the bullets from the list items.</li>

        <li>Each list item is given a float value of left. This allows each
        list item to sit side-by-side for a horizontal style menu.</li>

        <li>A clear left is added to the paragraph to prevent it from wrapping
        around the menu.</li>

        <li>Additional styling has been added to the anchor tags.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Things to try:</h3>

      <ul class="exercises">
        <li>Remove the float declaration to see the list items stack vertically
        by default.</li>

        <li>Change the float value from left to right. You may need to expand
        the output window area to see the effect.</li>

        <li>The paragraph will no longer be cleared with the last change.
        Change the clear value to right to clear the paragraph past the
        float.</li>

        <li>Add some additional menu items and styling.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Containing Floated Elements</h2>

      <p>When you float an element, it is being taken out of the normal flow of
      the page. This can have unwanted effects, especially when you have
      floated elements within a container element. Let&#39;s look at an
      example.</p>

      <figure>
        <a class="jsbin-embed" href=
        "http://jsbin.com/subupu/1/embed?html,css,output">Containing Floated
        Elements</a><script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.js">
</script>
      </figure>

      <h3>Take Note:</h3>

      <ul class="notes">
        <li>The floated cat image in the div with class container1 sticks
        outside of the div. This is not the behavior that would normally be
        desired.</li>

        <li>The floated cat image in the div with class container2 is
        contained, which is the effect that is normally desired. This can be
        achieved by setting the overflow to auto, hidden or scroll.</li>

        <li>Some browsers may need a height or width set for the container
        div.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Things to try:</h3>

      <ul class="exercises">
        <li>Set the overflow property to <em>auto</em> for the div with class
        container1. This will contain the image within the div.</li>

        <li>Remove the overflow declaration for both containers.</li>

        <li>Remove the clear declaration from the HR tag. This leaves us with
        the default behavior when floats are applied within a container.</li>

        <li>Remove the float declaration on the img tag to show that the images
        are contained when not floated.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Floats for layouts</h2>

      <p>Floating elements at one time was the only option to accomplish
      various types of layouts, but with CSS 2.1 and later specifications other
      options were made available that are considered to be improvements over
      floats. Let&#39;s look at how we can create a navigation menu without
      floats by using the inline-block display property</p>

      <figure>
        <a class="jsbin-embed" href=
        "http://jsbin.com/sonol/1/embed?html,css,output">Inline-block Nav
        Menu</a><script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.js">
</script>
      </figure>

      <h3>Take Note:</h3>

      <ul class="notes">
        <li>A horizontal menu is achieved by using the inline-block for the
        display value for the list items.</li>

        <li>A clear declaration is not needed on the paragraph that follows,
        since a float value is never used.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Things to try:</h3>

      <ul class="exercises">
        <li>Align the menu right by declaring a width of 300px, a margin-left
        of auto and a margin-right of 0 for the nav element. Revert your
        changes.</li>

        <li>Center align the menu by declaring margin-left and margin-right to
        have a value of auto for the nav element.</li>
      </ul>
