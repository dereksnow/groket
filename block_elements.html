            <h2>The Basics</h2>
            <p><strong>Block-level elements are HTML elements that are laid out
		    vertically on top of one another.</strong> These elements
	    typically have a line break before and after the element and occupy
	    the width of the containing element. Some commonly used block-level
	    elements include paragraphs (like this one), headings, list items
	    and tables.</p>
	    <p>Below is a code example containing elements that are block-level
	    by default: a paragraph, an unordered list and a table.</p>

		Block-level elements</a>

                <figcaption>
		    Background color styling has been added to show the area
		    that each block-level element occupies on the page. Also,
		    the default margins set by the browser has been reset to 0.

            </figure>
            <h3>Take Note:</h3>
            <ul class="notes">
		<li>Each block-level element vertically stacks on top of the
		other (like stacking blocks).</li> 
		<li>The width of a table
		element does not occupy the width of the containing element
		like the paragraph or the list. The W3C specification states
		that the width of a table element is determined by the user
		agent (e.g. browser), which is usually
                    the sum of the widths of the columns.
		</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Things to try:</h3>
            <ul class="exercises">
                <li>Add/Remove block-level elements to the jsbin above.</li>
                <li>Resize the area allocated to the output. How do the content change?</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>The DIV element and Nesting</h2>
            <p><strong>The &lt;div&gt; element is a block-level container
		    without any semantics, other than those that you apply with
	    id or class attributes.</strong> It is frequently used to style a group of flow content elements and create sectioned layouts, but it should not be used when a semantic element (e.g. nav, article, aside, header, footer etc) would be better suited
                for the content. <a href="http://html5doctor.com/downloads/h5d-sectioning-flowchart.png">Here's
a great flow chart</a> from
                <a href="http://html5doctor.com/">HTML5Doctor</a>that can help you decide which element you should use for a block of content.</p>
            <p>
                Another important characteristic of <strong>block-level
			elements</strong> is that they <strong>can generally
		have other block-level and <a
	href="inline_elements.html">inline elements</a> nested (contained)
within them</strong>. This nesting is often used to create interesting grid layouts. In the jsbin below, block-level elements are nested inside of other block-level elements to achieve a simple two column layout. The CSS used to achieve this particular
                layout will be discussed in a later section, but the HTML code shows the structure of this layout.</p>

                <script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.js"></script>
                <figcaption>Background color styling has been added to some of the &lt;div&gt; elements to show the area occupied on the page. The div with class container is partially occluded by the inner divs.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h3>Take Note:</h3>
            <ul class="notes">
                <li>A &lt;p&gt; element is nested within a &lt;div&gt; element, which is nested within another &lt;div&gt; element. This nesting is a common technique for achieving grid/column layouts.</li>
                <li><strong>A &lt;p&gt; element cannot contain block-level elements</strong>, but it can contain <a href="inline_elements.html">inline elements</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Things to try:</h3>
            <ul class="exercises">
                <li>Try adding a paragraph element inside of an existing paragraph element. What appears to happen? Revert your changes.</li>
                <li>Comment out the background color declarations for the two inner divs to reveal the background color of the container div. Revert your changes.</li>
                <li>Remove the <em>float: left;</em> declaration in the CSS tab. What happens? What do you think the float declaration is doing? Add the float declaration back, but change the value <em>left</em> to <em>right</em>. What happened? Float will be
                    covered in more detail in a later section.</li>
                <li>See if you can add two more divs to make a four column layout. You will need to make adjustments to the HTML and the CSS. This may be a small challenge, but if you look at the CSS, you can probably figure it out. The concepts to make this
                    type of layout will be covered in more detail in the CSS section.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>HTML5 and Block-level Elements</h2>
	    <p>In HTML5 <a
		    href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/indices.html#element-content-categories">element
	    content categories</a> were introduced, which replaced the simple
    block-level and inline distinction, but the block-level/inline
    categorization is still used in discussing the default behavior of
    elements. Mozilla provides a <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Block-level_elements">listing
of block-level elements</a> that also includes HTML5
                elements that are technically not defined within the block-level/inline categorization.</p>
            <h2>Big Ideas</h2>
            <ul class="big-ideas">
                <li>Block-level elements are laid out vertically on top of one another.</li>
                <li>The div element is a block-level element without semantics often used to create grid layouts.</li>
                <li>The div element should only be used when a semantic element wouldn't be better suited.</li>
                <li>Block-level elements can generally have other block-level and inline elements nested within them.</li>
                <li>The paragraph element cannot nest other block-level elements within it.</li>
                <li>HTML5 introduced element content categories which replaced the block-level/inline categorization, but the block-level and inline behavior of elements persists.</li>
