	    <p>HTML's role with regard to page layout is not as significant as
	    it was before CSS was introduced, but there are still some
		    important concepts to understand. The first is that
			    <strong> every HTML
	    element that appears on a web page is contained within a rectangle
	    or box</strong>.</p>
            </p>Below are two elements that you will find on many web pages: an image and some pre-formatted text.</p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-3">
                    <img src="images/soccerball.jpg" alt="Soccer Ball">
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-9">
                    <pre>
                       Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing
			    Cras volutpat tempor ligula eget elementum.
		               Quisque eu aliquam elit suscipit 
                                  urna elit, sollicitudin non
                                     consectetur dui ut 
                                        tellus ornare, 
		                          eu ultrices 
		                             nisl 
		    </pre>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
		<p>If we add borders to each of the elements, you can easily
		see the rectangular space that the elements occupy on the
			page. You can also inspect each of these elements
				using browser development tools to see the
					area occupied.</p> <div

		<p>Understanding that all elements on a page occupy a certain
		rectangular size is fundamental to understanding layouts. One
		of the other important concepts is that certain types of
		elements will begin on new lines by default (occupying the
		width of their container) while other types of elements don't start on a
		new line and only take up the width of their contents. These
			are known as <a href="block_elements.html">block-level</a> and inline elements respectively and
		will be the next topics discussed.</p>
